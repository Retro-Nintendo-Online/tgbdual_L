** Using Goomba / Goomba Color ROMs **

Goomba and Goomba Color are Game Boy emulators for the Game Boy Advance. This
version of TGB Dual can load the Game Boy ROMs stored within Goomba ROMs, and
can read and update the Game Boy SRAM stored inside Goomba .sav files. (If you
don't need to use Goomba / Gooomba Color, you can skip reading this file.)

First, you should go to Options -> Directories. Set the save directory to the
folder where your Goomba .sav files are stored. (You should also set the slot2
SRAM extension to "sav" instead of "sa2" - just don't run the same game with
the same save file in both windows.)

Then, you can open the Goomba / Goomba Color ROM with TGB Dual. The program
will go through every Game Boy ROM found in the file, asking whether you want
to load that ROM. Press "Yes" to load it or "No" to see what the next ROM is.

Notes:
* If no Goomba save file exists, TGB Dual will create a regular Game Boy
  save file - which is probably not what you want!
* TGB Dual can only save to a Goomba .sav file if the .sav file already
  contains save data for the game you are playing. This shouldn't be a
  problem - just run the Goomba or Goomba Color ROM at least once on a
  GBA (or GBA emulator) before running the ROM in TGB Dual.
